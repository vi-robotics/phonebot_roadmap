# Electrical Roadmap

Here are some ideas for plans to move forward with the electrical design

- Change processor from attiny and bluetooth module to a single ESP32
  - Add a front facing camera
  - Add a depth camera
- Potentially add Qi charging capability
- Potentially add solar charging capability
- Improve servo solder process
  - One idea is to make the servo board have slots instead of holes, so the wires can just be pressed into the slots and then soldered.
- Add current sensing to the full system load, or to individual servos
- Figure out how to maximize battery life and prevent batteries from getting puffy
