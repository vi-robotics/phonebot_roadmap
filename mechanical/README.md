# Mechanical Roadmap

Some ideas for moving forward with the PhoneBot mechanical system.

- Modify the leg mounting system to use a non-glue based snap on design
- Print in nylon or a more flexible material for the body and maybe legs we want to be softer
- Add 4 DOF so legs can move towards and away from the medial plane
  - This would require non-servos to be integrated as actuators for the third axis for each leg unless a new design could be developed
- Make injection molded legs to attach to servos with custom spline (this would superseed a snap-on design for the legs)
- Make a leg test rig which can test current load, leg response times, and maybe facilitate jumping tests/movement tests
- Make foot O-ring attach better
- Fix leg catching on the case issues
